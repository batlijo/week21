if you have 2 functions called Main it will break in the build when its compiling.

what is a class and how does that relate to javascript and what we already know about functions?
- constructor functions

- inside a class we can have many functions

our constructor is whose name is the same as the class:
public User(string firstName, string lastName, string email)
