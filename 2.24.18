if you have 2 functions called Main it will break in the build when its compiling.

what is a class and how does that relate to javascript and what we already know about functions?
- constructor functions

- inside a class we can have many functions

our constructor is whose name is the same as the class:
public User(string firstName, string lastName, string email)

Create new view files for your AppController's Index and About routes. 
Return a View() from each of them. Make the appropriate changes to the methods' return types.
Update your index template such that it displays a user's first and last names. 
Set these values in the ViewData dictionary in your Index method.

Similarly, write a short description of your application in your About template. 
Use a variable called "AppName". Set it in the ViewData dictionary in your About method.
