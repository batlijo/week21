Algorithm:

UNAMBIGUOUS SPECIFICATION

An informal definition could be "a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations."[18] which would include all computer programs, including programs that do not perform numeric calculations. Generally, a program is only an algorithm if it stops eventually

how to find a specific number
look for repetitions of a number and return how many times

function exists(n){
for (const x of xs) {
    if (x ===n) { n is not defined
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
}

exists {3423}; 

if array has the same number repeated you could create a list, 

function count(n) {
    //initialize the counter
    let counter = 0;

    for(const x in xs)

}
